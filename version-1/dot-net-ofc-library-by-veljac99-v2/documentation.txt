dot-net-ofc-library-by-veljac99-v2 is c# code based on dot-net-ofc-library-by-veljac99
(which was VB code)

You can find some documentation related to dot-net-ofc-library-by-veljac99 
(BUT NOT YET FOR dot-net-ofc-library-by-veljac99-v2)
at:



		http://www.ludegljive.com/Public/Open%20Flash%20Chart/



v2 is very similar to v1, and at the moment only OFC version-1 
(http://openflashchart.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openflashchart/version-1/actionscript) 
is supported, but I also started adding suport for OFC version-2.

You can also find some samples in subdirectory named "code" - under test web project.


PLEASE post your examples of usage and all those fancy graphs you create at

	veljac@ludegljive.com


so I can create some advanced usage samples, which will be published here.


FOR NOW PLEASE CONSIDER THIS VERSION AS "ALPHA" since additrional name cganges are possible
(I am still cleaning the code).

If you would like to help with coding, ideas or whatever please send me an e-mail
